## Python Exceptions

Read the info below so you can understand:

1. what an *exception* is
2. what *handling an exception* means
3. why handling exceptions is important

### What is an Exception?

In Python, an **exception** is an error that occurs when you run your script. When something goes wrong (e.g., the user tries to divide by zero, or attempts to access an item in a list that doesnâ€™t exist), Python **throws/raises** an exception. 

### Handling Exceptions

To put it another way, an **exception** is a signal that something went wrong when the user tried to run your script.  As a programmer, you can **handle** (*manage* or *deal with*) specific types of exceptions.

### Why Handle Exceptions?

Exceptions are bad because they can cause your script to crash, and users quickly get frustrated when they run a script that keeps crashing.

As a programmer, you should try to (1) anticipate exceptions and (2) try to write code that can handle exceptions (so your script exits gracefully and tells the user what the problem was instead of just suddenly crashing with no explanation why).
